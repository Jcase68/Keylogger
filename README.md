# This is currently a work in progress.
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a keylogger that will 
  -Be able to track the keystrokes of a user 
  -Send a copy of the keystrokes in a txt file to my email every 2 hours. 
Once those two basic functions have been completed other functions will be added such as:
  -tracking mouse activity
  -what programs did the user execute?
